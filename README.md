## What is AIbooking.dk?

AIbooking.dk is a complete, self-hostable **AI voice agent** (think: AI answering service / AI front desk) for small businesses — **clinics, salons, restaurants and hotels**. A caller dials your number; AIbooking.dk answers in under a second, holds a natural conversation in the caller's language, and actually *finishes the job*: it books the appointment, takes the order, answers the question, or hands off to a human with full context.

Unlike a phone tree or IVR, there are no menus. Unlike most "AI receptionist" SaaS products, AIbooking.dk is open source, runs on your own infrastructure, and **configures itself from a plain-English description of your business**.

## ✨ Features

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| 📞 **24/7 call answering** | Twilio Voice webhook → Claude conversation loop → natural spoken replies |
| 📅 **Appointment booking** | Live availability checks, proactive free-slot suggestions, double-booking protection, SMS confirmations |
| 🍽️ **Phone orders** | Item-by-item capture validated against the live menu — no $0 mystery items, accurate totals |
| ❓ **FAQ answering** | Answers from your business knowledge base; never invents prices or policies |
| 🌍 **8+ languages** | Detects the caller's language mid-sentence and switches voice + speech recognition to match (English, Hindi, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese) |
| 🧠 **Post-call intelligence** | Every call auto-analyzed: summary, sentiment, intent, resolution, staff action items, **upsell opportunities** |
| 👋 **Caller memory** | Recognizes returning customers by number — greets them by name, knows their history |
| ✨ **AI self-onboarding** | Describe your business in a paragraph; Claude generates the entire receptionist configuration |
| 🤖 **AI business reports** | Aggregate reasoning across all calls: trends, risks, concrete revenue recommendations |
| ✅ **Action item queue** | Callback requests and follow-ups become a live staff task list |
| 💬 **SMS layer** | Instant booking confirmations + a cron-able next-day reminder engine with dedup |
| 📈 **Analytics dashboard** | Automation rate, sentiment, intents, languages, peak hours, upsell radar |
| 🛠️ **Live knowledge editing** | Change services/FAQs in the dashboard; AIbooking.dk knows on the very next call |

## 🏗️ How it works

```
Caller ──▶ Twilio Voice ──▶ /api/voice/incoming   (greeting + <Gather> speech)
                       └──▶ /api/voice/respond    (speech → Claude → TwiML reply)
                                     │
                                     ▼
                     lib/agent — Claude Opus 4.8 tool loop
                     ├─ check_availability   ├─ find_free_slots
                     ├─ book_appointment     ├─ take_order
                     ├─ set_language         ├─ request_callback
                     └─ transfer_to_human
                                     │
                                     ▼
                     lib/insights — post-call analysis (structured output)
                     lib/digest   — cross-call business reports
                                     │
                                     ▼
                     /dashboard — live operations view
```

The agent runs a bounded tool-use loop with **server-side guardrails**: bookings re-verify slot availability at write time, orders are validated against the live menu, out-of-hours and past-date requests are rejected with corrective feedback the model uses to recover — the model is never trusted to have validated anything.

## 🧪 Quality

```bash
npm test          # unit tests (agent guardrails, scheduling, TwiML, i18n)
npm run typecheck # strict TypeScript
npm run build     # production build
npm run doctor    # check which integrations are configured
npm run seed:demo # fill the dashboard with realistic demo data
npm run eval      # live agent behavior evals (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
```

CI runs typecheck, tests and build on every push.
